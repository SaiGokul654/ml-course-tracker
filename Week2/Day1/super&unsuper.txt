Supervised learning:
                 ->The machine learns from the labled data and predits the value.
                 ->ex:images of cat and lion,each has diff feactures and we can predit it.

Unsupervised learning:
                 ->It will create clusters.ex:we wont tell this picture doesnt belong to lion,it shows as category.
                 ->It doesnt give direct output,it gives as category.
