Distance Of a Point From a Hyperplane:

->Hyperplane equation: wᵀx + w₀ = 0

->Normal vector: w = [w₁, w₂, ..., w_d]

->Point: P = [p₁, p₂, ..., p_d]

->Distance formula: d = (w₁p₁ + w₂p₂ + ... + w_dp_d + w₀) / √(w₁² + w₂² + ... + w_d²)

->If hyperplane passes through origin → w₀ = 0

->If w is a unit vector → denominator = 1

->Simplified distance: d = w₁p₁ + w₂p₂ + ... + w_dp_d + w₀
