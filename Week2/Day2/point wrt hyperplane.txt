HOW TO FIND THE PSOITION OF A POINT WRT HYPERPLANE:

A hyperplane is given by the equation: 
𝑤𝑇𝑥=0wTx=0.

To check a point’s position, compute the dot product: 
𝑤⋅𝑃w⋅P.

Dot product formula: 
𝑤⋅𝑃=∣∣𝑤∣∣∣∣𝑃∣∣cos(𝜃)
w⋅P=∣∣w∣∣∣∣P∣∣cos(θ).

The lengths are always positive, so the sign depends only on 
cos(𝜃)
cos(θ).

If 𝑤⋅𝑃>0
w⋅P>0 → point is on the positive side of the hyperplane.

If 
𝑤⋅𝑃<0
w⋅P<0 → point is on the negative side.

If 
𝑤⋅𝑃=0
w⋅P=0 → point lies exactly on the hyperplane.
