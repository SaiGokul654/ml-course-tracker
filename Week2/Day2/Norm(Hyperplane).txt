Assume that a plane is passing through origin,
               w0=0,
Eqn of hyperplane which is passing through origin,
               wt+w0=0,
               wt=0

               or
        w(bar)x(bar)=0
    we know a.b=a.b.costheta
    so,
    w.x=x.x.costheta=0

observe that ,inorder for dot product to be equal to zero ,the two vectors should be ORTHOGONAL or PERPENDICULAR.
